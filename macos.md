# System requirements
- Install Xcode.
- An APFS-formatted volume (this is the default format for macOS volumes).

# 1. Install depot_tools

Clone the depot_tools repository:

This collection of utilities from the Chromium project simplifies managing code repositories used in Chromium development. It includes tools like fetch, gclient, and cipd that streamline tasks like fetching code, managing dependencies, and interacting with Chromium's infrastructure.

```
$ git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
```

Add depot_tools to the end of your PATH (you will probably want to put this in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc). Assuming you cloned depot_tools to /path/to/depot_tools (note: you must use the absolute path or Python will not be able to find infra tools):



```
$ export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/depot_tools"
```

```
$ gclient
```
gclient: This specific tool within depot_tools plays a crucial role in fetching the Chromium source code and its dependencies. It leverages a .gclient file (generated by gclient config) that specifies locations and versions of the necessary codebases. gclient intelligently fetches the correct versions based on this configuration, ensuring a consistent and efficient development environment.


# 2. Fetch Chromium

Create a chromium directory for the checkout and change to it. You can call this whatever you like and put it wherever you like, as long as the full path has no spaces.

```
$ mkdir chromium && cd chromium
```

Use the fetch command from depot_tools to download the Chromium codebase and its dependencies. You can optionally use the --no-history flag to exclude the repository history, saving time:
```
$ fetch --nohooks --no-history chromium
```

# 3. Checkout

Then we need to check out the specific commit that MultiOnBrowser is based on.

MultiOn Browser is based on commit id : ecbf498e2027dad6dd44ef472b88ad59a0823bb8.

```
$ cd src
$ git fetch https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git ecbf498e2027dad6dd44ef472b88ad59a0823bb8 --depth 1
$ git checkout ecbf498e2027dad6dd44ef472b88ad59a0823bb8
```

It will take some mins.

# 4. Synchronize the Source Code

The .gclient file generated by fetch might contain scripts to be executed after fetching (hooks). These scripts could configure the environment, download additional tools, or perform other setup tasks. To run them, use:

```
$ gclient sync -D
$ gclient runhooks
```

# 5. Clean untracked files.
```
$ git status
$ git add --all
$ git reset --hard HEAD
```

# 6. Setting up the build

Chromium uses Ninja as its main build tool along with a tool called GN to generate .ninja files. You can create any number of build directories with different configurations. To create a build directory:

1. gn gen to configure a Chromium build for the release configuration and the ARM architecture.
2. `gn gen` is a GN command that takes arguments to specify the build directory and configuration options.

### Specifying Release Configuration and ARM Architecture:
The gn gen command requires two main arguments:
1. Build Directory: This is where the generated build files (e.g., `.ninja` files) will be placed. Traditionally, Chromium uses `out/` for the build directory.
2. Target Architecture: You can specify the target architecture using the target_cpu argument. For new macbook chips use `arm` else `release`.

```
gn gen out/release
```
New chips
```
gn gen out/arm
```

After "gn gen" command is executed, it will generated out\release folder and some files.
You can see args.gn file and open it in notepad or any text editor.

Write below Chromium build options and save in args.gn :
```
is_component_build = false
is_official_build = true
chrome_pgo_phase = 0
target_cpu = "x64"
is_debug = false
enable_nacl = false
blink_symbol_level = 0
symbol_level = 0
```

If you want to build for the Apple M Series (Apple Silicon), target_cpu must be set to "arm64".
This ensures that the build system compiles the code specifically for the ARM64 architecture used by the Apple M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, M1 Ultra, M2, and other Apple Silicon chips.

```
target_cpu = "arm64"
```

# 7. Build chromium

We need to build the checked out chromium first before multion browser patch.

```
$ autoninja -C out/release chrome
```

It will take several hours. (depends on the PC performance)

When the build is finished, you can see Chromium.app in out/release folder. 

You must get the successful build and you have to check build environment again.

# 8. Apply the patches for multion and rebuild

Run git command in chromium/src folder.

```
$ git apply --check /path/to/[patch file name for macos]
```

For example: git apply --check /Users/admin/multion-macos.patch

It must run without any errors.

```
$ git apply /path/to/[patch file name for macos]

$ git status
```
After this, you can check the modified files with git status command.

We need to build again with new patches.

```
$ autoninja -C out/release chrome
```
It will take some mins and you can see MultiOn.app in out/release folder.

# 9. Include the Mullion extension files in MultiOn.app

Copy unpacked multion extension folder. 

![copy_multion_extension](./img_mac/copy_multion_extension_folder.png)

Show package contents of MultiOn.app.

![show_package_contents](./img_mac/show_package_contents.png)

Open Contents folder.

Paste the unpacked multion extension folder to the Resources folder.

![paste_to_resources](./img_mac/paste_to_resources.png)
![paste_to_resources1](./img_mac/paste_to_resources1.png)

Run Multion.app

![multion_browser](./img_mac/multion_browser.png)



# _How to revert to the commit before applying the patch_?

If the patch file has been modified and you need to revert back to the initial Chromium commit, do the following:

```
$ git add .
$ git reset --hard HEAD
```

This will be reverted to the commit ID ecbf498e2027dad6dd44ef472b88ad59a0823bb8 that you initially checked out.

Repeat again from step 8.
